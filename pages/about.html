                Call me Danendra Eganatha Syahsamaauren if you feel formal, Ega if you feel like you know me. I'm making this portfolio site for my midterm assessment, or maybe beyond that, who knows? You can see that my face is green and glitchy for some reason. I don't know what causes that, or is it just that I like the color green. For those who don't know green in spanish is <i>verde</i>. Why am I telling you this? Well It's because I ran out of ideas and want to make this paragraph alone asc long as possible.

                If you're feeling a little bit personal and curious I live in Indonesia, Central Java. I'm not gonna tell you exactly where I live. My hobbies are mostly programming, graphic design, audiophiles, keyboardphiles, and drawing.

                    I do my computing on my Laptop and If I ever feel free maybe my Computer at home. My main OSes I like are mostly UNIX-Like. Like GUN.. I mean, GNU/Linux, the flavours of Linux. And to be specific, and what distribution I use is Arch Linux, for my Computer at home, and Fedora Workstation XX for my laptop. <i>Note: XX means Fedora ships major version every 6 months I think</i>. I also dualboot with MicrosoftÂ® Windows 11 on my Computer and Windows 10 on my laptop, just in case.

                Welcome to Heading 2! This is where I talk about nonesense for the rest of Heading 2! Anyways, how's your day?... I can't understand what you are saying, but since I'm an assumer I can assume that you're alright my assume. Did you know the earth is slightly buldging? I know right It's weird when what we can see from here, the ground It's just flat. Thats the end of Heading 2! See you later or maybe read my next friend; Heading 3! It's a bit smaller than me, not to ashame Heading 3 but that's just a fact.

                What a jerk that Heading 2 are saying that to me?! Though I agree I can't yap as much and I'm small. Anyways welcome to Heading 3! Probably that's what I can do to make this page long enough.
